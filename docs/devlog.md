### Verified Open-Meteo weather API for going-dark rule

Tested windspeed and visibility against a real AIS coordinate (Jan 15, 2024).

- Windspeed: confirmed via `archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive` â€” 24/24 hours populated.
- Visibility: not available on that endpoint. Confirmed instead via 
  `historical-forecast-api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast` (separate hostname) â€” 
  verified against the response's own timestamps, not just populated values, 
  after an earlier test falsely appeared to confirm visibility using a 
  different endpoint that actually returned today's weather, not 2024 data.

**Scope decision:** both windspeed and visibility are confirmed in scope. 
Both are model-derived estimates, not direct observations â€” fine for a 
plausibility filter. Phase 3 will need two hostnames and a batching strategy 
(group pings by hour + coordinate) rather than one API call per row.

**Lesson:** always check the response's actual timestamps, not just whether 
values are populated, before trusting an API test result.

**Status:** Open-Meteo task closed. Docs updated. Next: World Port Index.

- Created CLAUDE.md and docs/phase_plan.md, both committed to main
- Verified Claude Code reads @docs/ais_schema_notes.md correctly
- Cleaned up a stray "git status" file that got accidentally created
- Next session: verify Open-Meteo weather API, then WPI download

## 2026-07-01 — Phase 2: Duplicate removal (first cleaning rule)

Investigated why duplicate rows exist before deleting anything, rather than
running a blind dedup.

**What we found:**
- 176 rows are exact full-row duplicates (identical across all 17 columns).
- 18 more rows share the same vessel (MMSI) and timestamp but differ in
  position/course — these are legitimate distinct pings, NOT duplicates.

**Decision — full-row deduplication (Option A):**
- Deletes a row only if every one of the 17 columns matches another row.
- Considered a key-based approach (MMSI + time + LAT + LON) but it produces
  the identical result on this file while being harder to justify. Full-row
  is the most conservative option and needs no column-choice explanation.
- The 18 differing pings are correctly kept.

**Result:** 7,284,415 -> 7,284,239 rows (176 removed).
Implemented as drop_exact_duplicates() in src/validation/rules.py.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 2: Status / Draft / Cargo (no action)

Status, Draft, and Cargo each have ~26% nulls with no defined sentinel values.
Decision: leave them as-is. Filling nulls would require inventing data that was
never broadcast -- imputation here is fabrication, not cleaning.

Note: Status may be useful in Phase 3 for the loitering rule. A vessel with
Status = 'at anchor' in open water reads differently than one with no status
at all -- the field could help distinguish legitimate anchorage from suspicious
loitering. Revisit at that point.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 2: IMO sentinel flag

IMO == 'IMO0000000' is the AIS placeholder for vessels with no real IMO number.
Result: 1,759,246 rows flagged IMO_FLAGGED=True, 0 rows dropped. Slightly below
the raw-file count of 1,759,288 (42 were already removed as duplicates,
direct-counted).

Decision: flag, not null, not drop.
- None of the 5 anomaly rules read IMO directly (identity inconsistency is
  scoped as same MMSI, different VesselName).
- Nulling would blend genuine nulls (30.9% of rows) with placeholders (24.1%),
  making the two cases indistinguishable downstream.
- Dropping would lose 24% of rows over a field no rule uses.
- Flagging preserves the original IMO value, marks it unreliable, and loses nothing.
Implemented as flag_unreliable_imo() in src/validation/rules.py.
IMO_FLAGGED boolean column added; IMO field itself left untouched.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 2: Heading sentinel

Heading == 511 is the AIS "heading unavailable" sentinel. Nulled, rows kept.
Result: 3,723,977 values set to NaN, 0 rows dropped. Slightly below the
raw-file count of 3,724,055 (78 were already removed as duplicates).
Implemented as null_unavailable_heading() in src/validation/rules.py.

## 2026-07-02 — Phase 2: SOG sentinel

SOG == 102.3 is the AIS "speed unavailable" sentinel. Nulled, rows kept.
Result: 15,512 values set to NaN, 0 rows dropped. Slightly below the
raw-file count of 15,513 (1 was already removed as a duplicate).
Implemented as null_unavailable_sog() in src/validation/rules.py.

**Preliminary observation (unverified -- defer to Phase 3):** A scan of the
raw file shows ~244 rows with SOG > 50 knots outside the sentinel, clustered
across a small number of MMSIs. Not cleaned here -- these are candidates for
the speed-inconsistency anomaly rule, which will compute speed from position
deltas and compare against reported SOG. Specific breakdowns to be confirmed
when building that rule.

## 2026-07-01 — Phase 2: COG sentinel

COG=360.0 = "course unavailable" sentinel. No rule uses COG, so null the field
(don't drop rows). Result: 1,163,812 values set to NaN, 0 rows dropped.
Slightly below audit's 1,163,841 (29 were already removed as duplicates).
Implemented as null_unavailable_cog() in src/validation/rules.py.
