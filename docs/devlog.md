### Verified Open-Meteo weather API for going-dark rule

Tested windspeed and visibility against a real AIS coordinate (Jan 15, 2024).

- Windspeed: confirmed via `archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive` — 24/24 hours populated.
- Visibility: not available on that endpoint. Confirmed instead via 
  `historical-forecast-api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast` (separate hostname) — 
  verified against the response's own timestamps, not just populated values, 
  after an earlier test falsely appeared to confirm visibility using a 
  different endpoint that actually returned today's weather, not 2024 data.

**Scope decision:** both windspeed and visibility are confirmed in scope. 
Both are model-derived estimates, not direct observations — fine for a 
plausibility filter. Phase 3 will need two hostnames and a batching strategy 
(group pings by hour + coordinate) rather than one API call per row.

**Lesson:** always check the response's actual timestamps, not just whether 
values are populated, before trusting an API test result.

**Status:** Open-Meteo task closed. Docs updated. Next: World Port Index.

- Created CLAUDE.md and docs/phase_plan.md, both committed to main
- Verified Claude Code reads @docs/ais_schema_notes.md correctly
- Cleaned up a stray "git status" file that got accidentally created
- Next session: verify Open-Meteo weather API, then WPI download
